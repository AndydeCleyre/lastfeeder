CLI for creating RSS feeds from last.fm scrobbles
=================================================

Last.fm's official feeds are either dead or unreliable,
so you may want to maintain your own.

Originally this tiny project was engineered as a containerized server,
but is now using GitHub Actions to update the feeds
and GitHub Pages to host them.
